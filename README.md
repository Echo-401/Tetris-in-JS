# Tetris-in-JS
This is my go at making playable tetris on a website with Java Script
You control it with the arrow keys 
UP arrow -- rotates the current piece
LEFT/RIGHT arrow -- moves the current piece in its respective direction
DOWN arrow -- snaps the piece to the bottom of the bord or another piece
